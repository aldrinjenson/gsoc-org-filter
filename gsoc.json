Many of the most pressing questions about global change are not necessarily limited by the need to collect new data as much as by our ability to synthesize existing data. This project specifically seeks to improve this ability. Because no one measurement provides a complete picture, multiple data sources must be integrated in a sensible manner. Process-based models represent an ideal framework for integrating these data streams because they represent multiple processes at different spatial and temporal scales in ways that capture our current understanding of the causal connections across scales and among data types. Three components are required to bridge this gap between the available data and the required level of understanding: 1) a state-of-the-art ecosystem model, 2) a workflow management system to handle the numerous streams of data, and 3) a data assimilation statistical framework in order to synthesize the data with the model.","tech_tags":["r","docker","api","geospatial"],"topic_tags":["data science","ecosystem models","scientific visualization","climate science","Ecological Forecasting,"],"contact_links":[{"name":"chat","value":"https://join.slack.com/t/pecanproject/shared_invite/enQtMzkyODUyMjQyNTgzLWEzOTM1ZjhmYWUxNzYwYzkxMWVlODAyZWQwYjliYzA0MDA0MjE4YmMyOTFhMjYyMjYzN2FjODE4N2Y4YWFhZmQ"}],"source_code":"https://github.com/pecanproject/pecan","additional_comments":"","is_active":true,"date_created":"2022-02-21T16:55:04.563464Z","created_by":"","date_updated":"2022-02-21T16:55:04.563486Z","updated_by":"","direct_comm_methods":[{"name":"chat","value":"https://join.slack.com/t/pecanproject/shared_invite/enQtMzkyODUyMjQyNTgzLWEzOTM1ZjhmYWUxNzYwYzkxMWVlODAyZWQwYjliYzA0MDA0MjE4YmMyOTFhMjYyMjYzN2FjODE4N2Y4YWFhZmQ"}],"social_comm_methods":[],"ideas_link":"https://pecanproject.github.io/gsoc_ideas.html","agreements":[],"application_eligibility":{}},{"name":"The Palisadoes Foundation","slug":"the-palisadoes-foundation","reg_previous":true,"proj_start_year":2016,"reg_participation_years":["2021"],"logo_url":"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/the-palisadoes-foundation/d9zsxo0idjsl7kug.png","website_url":"https://www.palisadoes.org","tagline":"Improving community organization collaboration","license":"LGPL-3.0","categories":["End user applications","Social and communication"],"contributor_guidance_url":"https://palisadoesfoundation.github.io/talawa-docs/docs/internships/gsoc/gsoc-introduction","description":"The Palisadoes Foundation’s open-source software projects support community groups in organising their daily activities. A significant proportion of our software contributions come from university students studying software engineering. Participants often come from under-served communities or geographic areas and are sponsored through our various programs. This prepares them for the competitive realities of the working world.\n\nLife started for us in 2016 when a group of expatriate Jamaicans wanted to assist development of new and existing information technologies for the island’s social good.  We knew academic and student leadership wanted greater practical exposure to the latest technology. In response, our pilot Calico program for Jamaican universities was created with the goal of addressing the issues graduates would face when employed.\n\nAfter five years of success, members of the Jamaican diaspora suggested we expand our service area to be global. They saw similar needs in their own under-served communities where the digital divide is very visible and thought our experience in the developing world would be useful.\n\nFor the past four years we have focused on creating a mobile app to help community organizations like ourselves better manage their membership. We saw the need for a social media component to keep in contact with our volunteers.

If the developers need two technologies which are written in different programming languages, for instance, a C/C++ library called from NodeJS, the team usually needs to port to one of the two languages or write a wrapper around them. Maintaining a port of a library or the plumbing code is frequently error-prone, time-consuming, and does not add any value to the final product.\n\nThe main objective of MetaCall is to provide a transparent interoperability in both ways, no matter what language you are using, so you feel like you are using a library written in the same language but in fact, it may be written in C, NodeJS or any other language.\n\nMetaCall currently provides a mechanism to introspect the types and function signatures, which allows us to provide this type info to the caller language. You can have type safety and at the same time avoid boilerplate in both directions.\n\nIt addresses the main shortcomings of embedding independent languages separately. Having a common implementation with a plugin architecture allows you to implement newer languages without rewriting more code. With a single solution you get C#, Ruby, Python or any other language you prefer. We can improve the core continuously and add new languages.\n\nFinally, we are using the polyglot runtime in cloud computing so we take advantage of the interoperability capabilities and allow to build complex polyglot distributed systems with ease. It is possible to build monolithic and mono-repo projects that can be distributed and scaled separately through our Function as a Service built on top of MetaCall, allowing the developer to maximize the productivity without the need of DevOps plumbing or thinking about intercommunication protocols and architectural details.","tech_tags":["python","c++","rust","nodejs","docker"],"topic_tags":["cloud","polyglot","faas","languages","ffi"],"contact_links":[{"name":"email","value":"contact@metacall.io"},{"name":"chat","value":"https://discord.gg/upwP4mwJWa"},{"name":"chat","value":"https://t.me/joinchat/BMSVbBatp0Vi4s5l4VgUgg"},{"name":"chat","value":"https://matrix.to/#/#metacall:matrix.org"}],"source_code":"https://github.com/metacall","additional_comments":"","is_active":true,"date_created":"2022-02-17T12:17:37.056012Z","created_by":"","date_updated":"2022-02-17T12:17:37.056028Z","updated_by":"","direct_comm_methods":[{"name":"email","value":"contact@metacall.io"},{"name":"chat","value":"https://discord.gg/upwP4mwJWa"},{"name":"chat","value":"https://t.me/joinchat/BMSVbBatp0Vi4s5l4VgUgg"},{"name":"chat","value":"https://matrix.to/#/#metacall:matrix.org"}],"social_comm_methods":[],"ideas_link":"https://github.com/metacall/gsoc-2022","agreements":[],"application_eligibility":{}},{"name":"Wellcome Sanger Institute","slug":"wellcome-sanger-institute","reg_previous":false,"proj_start_year":2019,"reg_participation_years":[],"logo_url":"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/wellcome-sanger-institute/gmcjtlourmhkhhed.png","website_url":"https://www.sanger.ac.uk/programme/tree-of-life/","tagline":"Genome analysis across the whole tree of life","license":"MIT","categories":["Science and medicine","Data"],"contributor_guidance_url":"","description":"The Tree of Life programme of the Sanger Institute is generating high-quality reference genome assemblies for thousands of species, and releasing them to the community to help decipher genome function and organisation, and improve our understanding of biodiversity.

This set of mobile creativity tools for smartphones is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. The motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.\n\nOur awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need for any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in just a few steps using visual \"Bricks\". Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special \"Bricks\" for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro, etc.) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc. We also work on \"Pocket Code\" for iOS and on a large number of extensions. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up-to-date to meet the current needs of our users.\n\nMotivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award, the Austrian National Innovation Award or the Re-Imagine Education Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org), our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions.

Due to its support for features like the enforcement of constraints, transactions, prepared statements, and batch queries, it even goes beyond of what many well-known DBMS provide.\n\nMoreover, Polypheny comes with integrated support for several specialized database management systems. Therefore, it is able to efficiently process heterogeneous workloads. The seamless combination of data replication and data partitioning allows to combine different underlying data storage engines in order to provide excellent query performance independent of the type of workload.\n\nPolypheny even goes a step further in terms of flexibility: With \"Data Sources\" it is possible to map data on (remote) database systems into the schema of Polypheny. It also features adapters for directly querying CSV files or file systems. Thanks to GSoC 2021, Polypheny now even has support for querying the Ethereum Blockchain.\n\nThe JDBC, Python and REST query interfaces allow to easily integrate Polypheny into existing environments using industry standard techniques. It supports a broad spectrum of query languages including SQL, CQL, the MongoDB query language and the Pig query language. The powerful browser-based user interface makes managing Polypheny a pleasant experience.\n\nIn conjunction with the support for multimedia data and workloads, Polypheny offers a flexibility not matched by existing database systems.","tech_tags":["javascript","java","sql","angular"],"topic_tags":["database","big data","cloud","polystore","nosql"],"contact_links":[{"name":"email","value":"mail@polypheny.org"},{"name":"twitter","value":"https://twitter.com/polypheny"}],"source_code":"https://github.com/polypheny","additional_comments":"","is_active":true,"date_created":"2022-03-07T18:09:50.774598Z","created_by":"","date_updated":"2022-03-07T18:09:50.774623Z","updated_by":"","direct_comm_methods":[{"name":"email","value":"mail@polypheny.org"}],"social_comm_methods":[{"name":"twitter","value":"https://twitter.com/polypheny"}],"ideas_link":"https://polypheny.org/community/gsoc/","agreements":[],"application_eligibility":{}},{"name":"Software Heritage","slug":"software-heritage","reg_previous":true,"proj_start_year":2015,"reg_participation_years":["2019","2021"],"logo_url":"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/software-heritage/8vchqcnmijmq3ibq.png","website_url":"https://www.softwareheritage.org/","tagline":"The universal source code archive","license":"GPL-3.0","categories":["Data","Development tools"],"contributor_guidance_url":"https://wiki.softwareheritage.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2022#I_want_to_participate_as_a_student","description":"[Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org) is an archival project for source code and its development history.\n\nIts long-term mission is to collect, preserve, and share our entire Software Commons, that is the body of knowledge expressed as publicly available software source code.
